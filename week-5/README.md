# Week 5, Infrastructure as Code with OpenTofu

## What this does
Defines the Week 4 stack (Flask web app, PostgreSQL, storage, configuration, and secrets) as OpenTofu resources on a local k3s cluster.

## Requirements
- OpenTofu
- A running k3s cluster and ~/.kube/config
- The week-4-web:latest image imported into k3s (see Week 4)
- A terraform.tfvars file in week-5/ (copy terraform.tfvars.example and fill in real values)

## Deploy

    tofu init
    tofu plan
    tofu apply

## Verify

    kubectl get pods
    tofu output -raw web_port_forward

Run the command it prints, then visit http://localhost:8080 in a browser.

## Tear down

    tofu destroy

This deletes the database volume along with everything else.

## Known limitation

terraform.tfstate holds the database password and the Flask secret key in plain text. It is gitignored, not encrypted.
